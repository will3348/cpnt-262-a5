## Code Journal
- If I want to run the same code over and over again, each time with a different value, we have to write the code couple times.
- So, we can use loop to make it easier and more efficient. 
 ```Javascript
  for (let step = 0; step < 5; step++) {
   // Runs 5 times, with values of step 0 through 4.
   console.log('Walking east one step');
}
 ```
 ### The JavaScript ```for ```statement consists of three expressions and a statement:
 - ``` initialization``` - Run before the first execution on the loop. This expression is commonly used to create counters. Variables created here are scoped to the loop. Once the loop has finished its execution they are destroyed.
 - ```condition ```- The expression that's checked prior to the execution of every iteration. If omitted, this expression evaluates to true. If it evaluates to true, the loop’s statement is executed. If it evaluates to false, the loop stops.
 - ```condition ```- The expression that's checked prior to the execution of every iteration. If omitted, this expression evaluates to true. If it evaluates to true, the loop’s statement is executed. If it evaluates to false, the loop stops.
 - ```statement ```- Code to be repeated in the loop.
### Plan
1. going to play some fizz buzz games.
2. going to try code it without looking at sample code.
3. need to go over debug procedures again.
